Have you ever heard of the Kingdom of Lesotho?
Looking at a map, it appears as a region completely surrounded by South Africa.
At first glance, it might seem like a special district, but it's actually an independent country.

For someone like me, who was born on an island nation, just the idea of crossing into another country by land is surprising enough, but to think there's a country within a country is truly astonishing!

I came here to see the mysterious Kingdom of Lesotho with my own eyes. 🛬

Here's the travel company that took care of us ⬇️

<a href="https://sanipassprivatetours.com">サニパス＆レソト プライベートツアー</a>

The tours usually start from Underberg, but you can also arrange a pickup from Durban for an additional fee. Since we requested a pickup, they came to get us at 6 AM.
The sky was still dark, and I was sleepy 🥱
I decided to use the drive to Underberg as my sleep time and dozed off...

......

"We're taking a coffee break. We have about an hour left to Underberg, so let's take a short break."

That's how we ended up stopping at "ROX COFFEE."

Determined to get some delicious coffee, I headed to the counter and, to my surprise, found "Vegan Hot Chocolate" on the menu. 🍫
Holding a warm, sweet drink in the morning feels so comforting. I returned to the car with my cup in hand.

Sipping the hot chocolate and gazing out the car window, we soon arrived at the reception area.

We said goodbye to our driver and met up with our tour guide, Mr. D.
Mr. D is a large, gentle-looking man.

We'll be in your care for the next three days. 🙇

After using the restroom, we switched to a 4WD vehicle and set off towards Sani Pass.

"Sani Pass" is a road that connects South Africa and Lesotho, located in the Drakensberg Mountains, a World Heritage site.
It's a popular spot visited by many tourists aiming to cross into Lesotho or just to see the stunning mountain scenery. ⛰️

![alt](/images/columns/2/3.webp)

The image below is of the 4WD vehicle we'll be using for the next three days. With this, we can feel safe even on the mostly unpaved roads of Lesotho!

![alt](/images/columns/2/4.webp)

After about an hour, we arrived at Sani Pass.
We're finally entering the gorge.

![alt](/images/columns/2/5.webp)

We proceeded along the rough, winding roads, shaking and bouncing,

![alt](/images/columns/2/66.webp)

Further swaying as we moved beyond Sani Pass.

![alt](/images/columns/2/67.webp)

We reached our second destination.
Crossing a small stream to reach the place with rock paintings.
There's no bridge, so we step on large stones and rocks to cross.

![alt](/images/columns/2/6.webp)

After reaching the other side, we climbed the mountain through the grass,

![alt](/images/columns/2/7.webp)

and arrived at the place with the rock paintings.
It's fascinating to see the paintings created by the San people who lived here long ago.

![alt](/images/columns/2/8.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/9.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/10.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/11.webp)

f I recall correctly, this painting depicts a gathering of many people doing something...
Our guide explained it in detail, but I forgot after seeing so many sights. I should have taken notes. ✍️

![alt](/images/columns/2/12.webp)

Leaving the rock paintings behind, we reached the border.
We had our passports stamped for entry.
The stamp was engraved with "Sani Pass."
Finally, we entered the Kingdom of Lesotho. ✨

![alt](/images/columns/2/14.webp)

Our next stop was the "Highest Pub in Africa."
At an altitude of 2,874 meters!
It's slightly lower than the summit of Mt. Fuji, and yet there's a pub. 👀

![alt](/images/columns/2/15.webp)

After a break, it was lunchtime.
Today's lunch was a Lesotho home-cooked meal.
I was excited to try Lesotho cuisine for the first time. 🍽️

![alt](/images/columns/2/16.webp)

We arrived at a traditional Lesotho house with a conical roof, where the meal was already prepared.
It looked delicious. 🧡

![alt](/images/columns/2/63.webp)

"Ugali & Stir-fried Sukuma Wiki"
Ugali is a traditional Lesotho staple food made by cooking corn or other grain flour with water.
Sukuma Wiki is a type of kale, stir-fried and eaten with the staple Ugali.
It was delicious. ✨

It's vegan.

![alt](/images/columns/2/64.webp)

Soft bread baked over an open flame. 🍞
Since I couldn't eat it all at once, I took some back to the car for a snack later.

![alt](/images/columns/2/17.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/65.webp)

Nibbling on bread, we passed through Lesotho's highest point, the "Highest Point,"

![alt](/images/columns/2/18.webp)

and arrived at a healer's village.
Inside the triangular-roofed house in front of us, rituals are performed.
A healer dressed in traditional attire prays for the happiness of visitors.

Since it's a sacred place, I can't show any images. If you're interested, please visit in person.

![alt](/images/columns/2/19.webp)

After leaving the healer's village, we ventured deeper into Lesotho.

![alt](/images/columns/2/20.webp)

We saw a diamond mine from the car,

![alt](/images/columns/2/21.webp)

and passed by charming houses with triangular roofs... and discovered something interesting. 💡

![alt](/images/columns/2/22.webp)

The mountain was marked with "OXBOW."
"OXBOW" is the name of the village. The village name was carved into the mountain.

![alt](/images/columns/2/23.webp)

The 4WD vehicle ventured further into Lesotho, and by the time it was completely dark,
we arrived at our accommodation for the night, Bird Haven Guesthouse Leribe Lesotho.
It's a lovely guesthouse with traditional cone-shaped roofs. 🏠

After enjoying a delicious vegetarian dinner,
we prepared for tomorrow's long drive and went to bed. 🛏️💤

Day 2 started at the "Ha Kome Cave."

![alt](/images/columns/2/26.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/27.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/28.webp)

"Ha Kome Cave" is a cave village built about 200 years ago by the Kome people who were attacked by other tribes.
They created this cave village to escape their enemies.
While large families, led by the patriarch, lived here back then, only one person lives here today...

![alt](/images/columns/2/29.webp)

"Wait, someone still lives here?!"
I asked in surprise.
Yes, this is both a tourist spot and an actual residence!

"But the young people have all moved out and live on higher ground."
explained the guide.
As I toured, the resident woman was going about her daily life, starting a fire and doing chores.

![alt](/images/columns/2/30.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/31.webp)

There are rock paintings here too.
It feels like the country's history is etched everywhere.

![alt](/images/columns/2/32.webp)

After leaving the cave, we headed to the
Thaba Bosiu Cultural Village.

![alt](/images/columns/2/33.webp)

After purchasing tickets at the reception, a guide came to show us around the facility.

![alt](/images/columns/2/34.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/35.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/2/36.webp)

In the village, there was a monument-like structure right.

![alt](/images/columns/2/37.webp)

This is Moshoeshoe I, the first king of the Kingdom of Lesotho. He is a hero of Lesotho who protected the Sotho people from the San people and founded the nation.

![alt](/images/columns/2/38.webp)

This house resembles the round-roofed houses in "Ha Kome."

![alt](/images/columns/2/39.webp)

What do you think this place with evenly placed stones in a circular area is?
Actually, this is a school ✏️📖

Each student uses one stone as their desk or chair. It's an open-air school 🌞

![alt](/images/columns/2/41.webp)

After learning about Lesotho's culture, we head to see dinosaur footprints. But before that, it's lunchtime 🥪. We have sandwiches and lots of fruits 🍎🍐🥝 made by the hotel, and 100% berry mix juice 🧃. The sandwiches are vegetarian.

![alt](/images/columns/2/42.webp)

View from the car window during the drive.

![alt](/images/columns/2/43.webp)

As we drive, the weather turns ominous, and by the time we see the signboard with the dinosaur footprints illustration, the ground is already muddy...

![alt](/images/columns/2/25.webp)

But we can't give up after coming this far! Determined, we climb the mountain.

![alt](/images/columns/2/44.webp)

And we finally arrive at the footprints.
It may seem like we got there quickly, but that's not the case 😭. I was too busy trying not to slip and fall during the climb to take pictures. However, I managed to take a clear shot of the footprints 👍.

![alt](/images/columns/2/46.webp)

The footprint matches the illustration on the signboard.

![alt](/images/columns/2/45.webp)

The guide pointed towards the direction from which the dinosaur came, saying, "It came from over there."

There are other types of footprints, like these.

![alt](/images/columns/2/47.webp)

And some with long fingers.

The guide explained the names, but since I'm not familiar with dinosaurs, the information went over my head, so that, I forgot.

![alt](/images/columns/2/48.webp)

Having managed to see the dinosaur footprints, we head to the final sightseeing spot of the second day, the "Blanket Shop." On the way, we see a U-shaped bend in the river.

![alt](/images/columns/2/49.webp)

"Ah, got it💡"

The town's name, "OXBOW," means "a land enclosed by a U-shaped bend in a river" in English. Could the town's name "OXBOW" be derived from this river? If anyone knows, please let me know 🙏.

Then we arrive at the shop. The vivid blue door is cute 💙.

![alt](/images/columns/2/50.webp)

Since it's a shop, I thought it was time to buy souvenirs, but instead, it was a wonderful demonstration shop showing precious blankets with explanations ✨. In Lesotho, where the entire country is over 1,000 meters above sea level, cold protection is essential. Blankets are indispensable for the people of Lesotho.

The blanket in the image below features a horse and horseshoes.

"The women of Lesotho wrap themselves and their sick babies in this blanket and ride horses to the hospital."

That's what the lady at the shop told me. The precious horse depicted on the precious blanket shows how much the people of Lesotho value their natural resources.

![alt](/images/columns/2/51.webp)

She showed us other blankets with heart-like patterns and more.

![alt](/images/columns/2/52.webp)

When the demonstration ended, it was already dark outside.

"It's a bit far to the hotel."

Now, we are heading to Semonkong, passing through the capital, Maseru. While gazing at the exotic night scenery of the rainy town, I dozed off and woke up to find we had arrived at the hotel.

We stayed at Semonkong Lodge, a lovely lodge with a fireplace in the room 🪵.

![alt](/images/columns/2/53.webp)

Early the next morning, we headed to Maletsunyane Falls, the largest waterfall in Lesotho, in the cold and dim light. And our travel companion is this pony 🐎.

At this hotel, you can experience horseback riding! As someone who wanted to travel like the people of Lesotho, I naturally signed up for horseback riding.

While being careful not to fall off the pony, we headed to the waterfall. When the road split, I tried to guide the pony by pulling the reins, but the pony ignored my guidance and chose the safest path on its own. Very reliable 💪.

![alt](/images/columns/2/54.webp)

By the time we reached the waterfall, it was bright, and the morning sun was sparkling. The vast landscape spread out before us.

"Waterfalls are made by water flowing down from a river, right?"
I was surprised by such an obvious fact.

Or I remembered my social studies teacher's words, "Civilizations develop along water bodies."

![alt](/images/columns/2/55.webp)

After enjoying the waterfall and the horse, we had breakfast and checked out. On the final day, we head to Underberg.

The last sightseeing spot is here. We stroll along a street lined with local shops.

![alt](/images/columns/2/56.webp)

I spotted the word "vodacom" 💡
Can you buy SIM cards here?

![alt](/images/columns/2/57.webp)

After the town walk, it's just a long drive 🚗.

![alt](/images/columns/2/58.webp)

It's sad to say goodbye to the mountains of Lesotho, which I have grown so fond of...

![alt](/images/columns/2/59.webp)

Lunch was sandwiches made by the lodge, an apple, sweet treats, and apple cider.
We had our last meal in Lesotho on a small hill by the roadside.

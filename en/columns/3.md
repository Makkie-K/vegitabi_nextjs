A mysterious room I happened to come across while strolling through the newly opened Azabudai Hills.  
Beyond the sophisticated entrance, there was a small box-like space surrounded by pictures drawn with lights.

"Art gallery?"

I asked to the women at the entrance and she told me that this gallery was partially free to enter. Therefore, I entered and looked around.

In the small box, a woman was sitting alone with a tea bowl, and further back, there appeared to be tea ceremony utensils.

"Tea ceremony?"

There was also a feature of the tea ceremony's room as apparently "Nijiriguchi".  
It had a QR code aside, and it linked to the booking page.

"Enjoying matcha in a small room surrounded by digital art?"

Digital art in contrast to traditional tea ceremony...

I spun my brain at high speed and inflated my imagination to the maximum, but I still have no idea.

Is it traditional or not? When I think about it carefully, is there really a reason to confine the tea ceremony to Japanese culture?

This mysterious space—no, this experience that goes beyond imagination—made me want to try it no matter what, so I hurriedly made a reservation.

------ And then, the day arrived.

To fully immerse myself in the 'fusion of digital art and tradition,' I arrived a bit early and carefully read the explanations hung on the wall.

![alt](/images/columns/3/1.webp)

I was attracted by the opening line such as "Life is like a fleeting dream...", and continue reading...

「乗燭夜遊」(Carpe Diem)  
「Memento Mori」  
「Differential Ontology」

Even though I felt like my heart would break as the sentences were full of words I didn't know, I started to get a vague idea of ​​the world...

"I've got it!"

I came to the realisation that this is an explanation of today's event💦

When I first saw the title, it looked too difficult to understand, but after reading the meaning deeply, I found that the title is not only novel, but also impressive.

![alt](/images/columns/3/3.webp)

Let's look at arts! Does this art show "Noise"?
I was thinking as if this fluid art may be expressed "Nothing lasts forever".

![alt](/images/columns/3/6.webp)

"Please wait at the counter beyond♪"
I was asked, and went there...

Here was aslo crowded with a lot of art.

![alt](/images/columns/3/7.webp)

There were many things related to Mr. Ochiai on the ceiling as well.

When I sat in the high chair, hot water was served.
Was it to cleanse my mouth? I made it empty completely.

![alt](/images/columns/3/9.webp)

During drinking hot water, 2 pieces of paper were given by the facilitator.  
I was able to make out the information for the hermitage "Null" and the picture looked like a map, but the rest was so well written that I couldn't read it😭

Still never worries!
The faciliator will guide you properly💁‍♀️
Once explaining the process, we will all head to the garden.

The path leading to the garden was also decorated with paintings and objects.

This painting is of a mackerel.
This mackerel will appear again later, so please remember it ✨

![alt](/images/columns/3/11.webp)

And so we arrived at the garden.
While listening to the murmur of the water, we enjoy the silence for a while... Ah, this might be what 'Silence' is.

So, does that mean 'Null' for 'Null-an'?

This is A bamboo ladle. It has a certain elegance🎋
In reality, there is a disinfectant spray next to it, so we cleanse our hands in a modern way, though🖐️

After fully experiencing nature, we return to the jewel-like tea room and finally enter inside.

The view from the nijiriguchi.

![alt](/images/columns/3/20.webp)

The lighting changes vibrantly, reflecting off the lens wall and creating a magical atmosphere.

![alt](/images/columns/3/21.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/3/22.webp)

The japanese sweet served with tea is 'Tororo' from Suzukake in Fukuoka, Hakata.  
(ingredients: Rice flour, Yam, Red beans, Glutinous Rice flour, Syrup)

The simple and elegant sweetness gives an impression of 'serenity.

![alt](/images/columns/3/23.webp)

Next, we will have light green tea.  
My mind has become completely calm, but...

![alt](/images/columns/3/24.webp)

My eyes and ears are overwhelmed by the thunderous sounds echoing through the room and the intensified lighting effects from the lenses🌀

![alt](/images/columns/3/25.webp)

Upon entering the tea room, I realized that the exhibited works were designed to change dramatically when viewed through the lenses from inside the room!

Individual art was impressive on its own, but experiencing them through the tea ceremony made people realise that the same artwork could appear differently.

Viewing the artwork individually from outside the tea room is similar to perceiving the world in a 'static' state,

whereas seeing it from inside the tea room through the lenses resembles how we experience the world through our eyes, that is, our physical bodies. I can’t help but reflect on this...

![alt](/images/columns/3/26.webp)

Thinking about it that way, I believe that experiences that evoke our emotions—joy, anger, sadness, and pleasure—are a form of entertainment.

![alt](/images/columns/3/27.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/3/28.webp)

Now, it is the time to look back the painting of 'Mackerel' previously appeared🐟

The three images below all show the same 'Mackerel' seen from inside the tea room.
The painting of 'Mackerel' itself is the same, but the surroundings look different.  
It impresses impermanence of affairs

![alt](/images/columns/3/29.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/3/30.webp)

![alt](/images/columns/3/31.webp)

The tea ceremony is an attraction, but ‘impermanence of affairs’ is not something that happens only within its attraction, also it is our life itself.

This experience was thought-provoking that I push me to enjoy 'irreversible passage of time' while finding tiny differences in a life.

![alt](/images/columns/3/32.webp)

After leaving the tea room, I found a nostalgic rotary dial phone in the back☎️

![alt](/images/columns/3/33.webp)

You can hang up the phone and ask questions, and then, Mr. Ochiai replies✨

The exhibition runs until 17 March, so it is nearing its end, but why not come and enjoy Yoichi Ochiai's world view while having a meal at the restaurant attached to the exhibition?
